# EcoMatrix üåçüé®

EcoMatrix is a **React + TypeScript single-page application** that empowers anyone to create **AI-generated comics about climate change and environmental solutions**.  
It combines storytelling, personalization, and cutting-edge AI to make climate education inspiring, hopeful, and fun.  

 This project was built as part of my participation in the **Nano Banana Hackathon by Google DeepMind**, showcasing the creative use of Gemini models for interactive storytelling and education.
